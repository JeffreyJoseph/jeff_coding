1. Create a package 'bliffoscope' and put all the source code into it. Please put image and target
   files in the same package as that of the source code.

2. Please set the relative path of image file in 'image' parameter in files.properties

3. Please set the relative path of all target files in 'targets' parameter in files.properties.
   The different target file paths has to be separated by a semi-colon.
   
4. If the scanned target from the image has to be printed, set the 'print_target' parameter in
   files.properties to 'Y'.
   Irrespective of this option, the coordinates of the target will be printed.
   
5. Set the acceptable match percentage for the target in 'match_percentage' parameter in 
   files.properties. Enter only integers ranging between 1 to 100 (both inclusive).

6. Please run Bliffoscope.java which is compatible to run on Java 1.6 

Assumptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Match percentage of 70 has been set in the properties file. A match percent of less than
   70 will not be considered as a potential target.
   To change this value, please do so in the properties files. Enter only integers ranging between
   1 to 100 (both inclusive).
   
2. If the target image is bigger than input image, the target will not be looked for. Instead, the
   number of matching targets will be returned as -1.
